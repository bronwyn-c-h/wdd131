        <h2>Love</h2>
        <p>As Elder Gary E. Stevenson has said, "The first thing we can do is love as Christ loved"(April 2022).</p>
        <p>When we serve others, we are being missionaries and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>In 2 Nephi 31:20 it says, "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."</p>
        <p>God will bless us for our faithfulness. He wants all his children to know that He loves them. We can be his servants and spread the gospel.</p>

        <h2>Share</h2>
        <p>We share things all the time with people. Our likes, dislikes, what we did that weekend, our feelings and many other things. We can also share the gospel. We can share that we went to church or what we read in our scripture study that day. </p>
        <p>Lehi from the Book of Mormon is a great example of this: "12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.(1 Nephi 8)"</p>
        <p>After learning about the gospel and the love of God, he felt the need to share it with his family.</p>

        <h2>Invite</h2>
        <p>Inviting others to come to Christ can seem intimidating. We don't know how they will act or receive the invitation. However, we can invite in small and simple ways. We can share a scripture with them, invite them to a church activity. If we're really feeling brave we can invite them to church or to meet with the missionaries. This doesn't mean that they will accept the invitation, but we can know we did our part.</p>
        <p>One of my personal favorite scriptures is Alma 37:6 "...Behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass;"</p>
        <p>Heavenly Father will always bless us for our efforts to share the gospel and be a participant in His work.</p>
