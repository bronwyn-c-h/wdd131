        <h2>What is repentance?</h2>
        <p>According to the Bible Dictionary, repentance "denotes a change of mind, a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world."</p>
        <p>I love this description of repentance. Repentance is not a something to be ashamed of. We are all mortal and need the chance to change and reset.</p>
        <p>In Mosiah 26 verse 29, the Lord said "29 Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also."</p>
        <p>Repentance is an action. It is the change in behavior, so that we can be more like Christ.</p>

        <h3>How can I repent?</h3>
        <p>We don't need to do any drastic changes at the same time. We've been taught to make a habit daily repentance. This means we make small changes over time.</p>
        <p>Heavenly Father asks that we come to him with a broken heart and contrite spirit. "And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit."(3 Nephi 12:19)
            It's simple for a reason. Heavenly Father knows we like to complicate things. I think that's why he made it so simple.

        <h3>Is there hope for me?</h3>
        <p>There is always hope. God will accept anyone who is will to come back to him.</p>
        <p>One scripture that always brings me hope is found in Mosiah 26 "30 Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me."
            It doesn't matter how many times we have to come back, even for the same mistake, He will forgive us.
